# Movie-Recommender-System Model - Takes input either by movie name or by genre and keywords and recommends 10 movies accordingly.
Overview
This repository contains a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences and previous watch history. The system uses various algorithms such as Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering to generate movie recommendations. The project also integrates machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques to provide accurate and personalized suggestions.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarity in features (genre, keywords, etc.).

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on users' previous preferences and behavior.

Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between movies for better recommendations.

Interactive User Interface: Accepts user input to personalize movie suggestions.

Technologies Used
Python (Programming Language)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning library for vectorization and similarity calculation)

Pandas (Data manipulation)

NumPy (Numerical operations)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data visualization)

Flask (Web framework for user interface - optional)

Google Colab Notebook (For data exploration and model training)
